# Lung-Cancer-Detection-and-Classification-Using-Deep-Learning
This project aims to identify lung cancer from CT-SCAN images using Deep Learning. It is basically a image-based classification. 
This paper works on using popular Convolution Neural Network Models to detect Lung Cancer from CT-Scan images. Lung diseases are certainly the lung-affecting sicknesses which impair the respiratory mechanism
